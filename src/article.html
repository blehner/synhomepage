            <p class="lead">Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a
                tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.</p>
            <p>By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and
                more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing
                user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em> just trying to style some content that came from a
                rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.</p>
            <p>We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my <code>h1</code> elements? How do I disable this?
                    What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You
                don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code> element in a piece of
                your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you
                want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not awful.</p>
            <p>The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt to give you what you <em>actually</em>
                want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.</p>
            <p>It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it
                into a beautiful, well-formatted document:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;article class="prose"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

            <p>For more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, <a

            <h2>What to expect from here on out</h2>
            <p>What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It
                includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like <strong>bold text</strong>, unordered
                lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, <em>and even italics</em>.</p>
            <p>It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We want everything to look good out of the box.</li>
                <li>Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.</li>
                <li>Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with
                    two items.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now we're going to try out another header style.</p>
            <h3>Typography should be easy</h3>
            <p>So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty
                reasonable.</p>
            <p>Something a wise person once told me about typography is:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it
                    won't be bad.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556740758-90de374c12ad?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80"
                    alt="" />
                <figcaption>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                    of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>So here is the first item in this list.</li>
                <li>In this example we're keeping the items short.</li>
                <li>Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And that's the end of this section.</p>
            <h2>What if we stack headings?</h2>
            <h3>We should make sure that looks good, too.</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top
                margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than
                a paragraph followed by a heading should be.</p>
            <h3>When a heading comes after a paragraph …</h3>
            <p>When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now
                let's see what a more complex list would look like.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>I often do this thing where list items have headings.</strong></p>
                    <p>For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get
                        the styles right.</p>
                    <p>I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the
                        spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense.
                        Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Since this is a list, I need at least two items.</strong></p>
                    <p>I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it
                        only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second
                        list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.</strong></p>
                    <p>I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse,
                        and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well
                        include it.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird
                jumping right to a heading.</p>
            <h2>Code should look okay by default.</h2>
            <p>I think most people are going to use <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or <a
                    href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or something if they want to style their code blocks but it
                wouldn't hurt to make them look <em>okay</em> out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.</p>
            <p>Here's what a default <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file looks like at the time of writing:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
